Scrypt - Simple Cryptography Library
-----------------------------------

This library was created to abstract the most common cryptographic techniques 
in a way that is easy to get working and is consistant with boost/c++ practices.

The ultimate goal is to remove the dependence on OpenSSL, but for now that is
a behind-the-scenes implementation detail.  None of the headers depend upon
OpenSSL.

At the moment this library implements the following:

- SHA1
- RSA Encryption/Description/Signatures
- Blowfish 
- Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
- Super Fash Hash (Paul Hsieh)
- Lookup3 (John Jenkins)

### RSA Basic Usage ### 

  using namespace scrypt;

  // rsa 2048 (default)
  public_key_t  pub;
  private_key_t priv;

  generate_keys( pub, priv );

  std::vector<char> in;
  std::vector<char> out;

  pub.encrypt(in,out);
  priv.decrypt(out,in);

  signature_t sig;
  priv.sign( sha1_hash(in), sig );
  pub.verify( sha1_hash(in), sig );

  // rsa 1024 bit
  public_key<1024>    pub1024;
  private_key<1024>   priv1024;
  signature_key<1024> sig1024;

  generate_keys( pub1024, priv1024 );

### Blowfish Basic Usage ###

  using namesapce scrypt;

  blowfish bf;
  bf.start( "Some Key", strlen("Some Key") );

  // must be a multiple of 8 bytes
  char in_out[8*rand()];

  bf.encrypt( in_out, sizeof(in_out) );
  bf.reset_chain();
  bf.decrypt( in_out, sizeof(in_out) );


### Diffie-Hellman Usage ###

  diffie_hellman dh;
  // Public Parameters, do this one and save
  // both machines need this data.
  dh.generate_params( 1024/*prime length*/, 5 );
  
  // Machine A
  diffie_hellman dha;
  dha.p = dh.p;
  dha.g = dh.g;

  dha.generate_pub_key();
  // send dh.pub_key to machine B

  dha.compute_shared_key( dhb.pub_key );
  blowfish bf( &dha.shared_key.front(), dha.shared_key.size() );

  // Machine B
  dhb.p = dh.p;
  dhb.g = dh.g;

  dhb.generate_pub_key();
  // send dh.pub_key to machine A

  dhb.compute_shared_key( dha.pub_key );
  blowfish bf( &dhb.shared_key.front(), dhb.shared_key.size() );
